# CNS_Assignments
Laboratory ssignments given during the Computational NeuroScience(CNS) course.

## Assignment 1
1. The assignment consists of the following points:

2. Implement the Izhikevich’s model in Matlab
Develop all the 20 neuro-computational features of biological neurons using the model developed at point 1) and plot: 
    - the resulting membrane potential’s time courses into individual figures (one figure for each neuro-computational feature);
    - the phase portraits that correspond to each of the neuro-computational features (one figure for each neuro-computational feature).
